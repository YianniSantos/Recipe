                <p>Butterfly and split each chicken breasts into two portions, <br>
                    making four pieces total. Cover chicken with plastic wrap and <br>
                    pound each piece to an even 1/4-inch thickness with the flat side <br>
                    of a meat mallet.</p>

                <li><b>Dredge chicken, flour, and egg:</b></li>
                <p>Season chicken cutlets with salt and pepper on each side. Then working <br>
                    with one at a time, dredge both sides in flour mixture, transfer to <br>
                    eggs and dredge both sides, lift and let excess run of.</p>
